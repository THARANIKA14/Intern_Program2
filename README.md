# OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM
## Student Grade Calculator

The *Student Grade Calculator* is a simple Java-based command-line application designed to calculate the average grade, letter grade, and GPA (Grade Point Average) based on a student's input for multiple subjects. This project is a demonstration of Java programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, arrays, and user input handling.

## Features
- Accepts the number of subjects and grades as input from the user.
- Computes the following:
  - *Average Grade*: The sum of grades divided by the number of subjects.
  - *Letter Grade*: Based on the average grade, using the following scale:
    - A for grades >= 90
    - B for grades >= 80
    - C for grades >= 70
    - D for grades >= 60
    - F for grades < 60
  - *GPA*: A simple GPA system ranging from 10.0 to 0.0.
- Provides a concise summary of the results.

## Technologies Used
- *Programming Language*: Java
- *Development Environment*: Any Java IDE or terminal with JDK installed.

## How to Run the Application
1. Clone the repository or download the StudentGrade.java file.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) or terminal.
3. Compile the program using the following command:
   ```
   javac StudentGrade.java
   ```
4. Run the program using:
   ```
   java StudentGrade
   ```
5. Follow the prompts to enter the number of subjects and grades for each subject. The program will calculate and display the grade summary.

## Example Output
```
Enter the number of subjects: 3
Enter grade for subject 1: 85
Enter grade for subject 2: 90
Enter grade for subject 3: 78

--- Grade Summary ---
Average Grade: 84.33333333333333
Letter Grade: B
GPA: 8.0
